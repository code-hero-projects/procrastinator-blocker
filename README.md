# Procrastinator Blocker

This project is a browser extension that tries to keep you focused on a task. This is done by showing a page everytime you try to go to a website you shouldn't be browsing, like Instagram, Reddit or whatever you want.

There's an options menu that allows you to configure on which websites the extension works. Other configuration includes the time the extension is active and what is shown when you try to access a website.

When the extension starts a timer shows up. Everytime you go to a website it will check if such website is on the database, and if it is a page is shown instead of the website. The extension will then only disable itself when the timer is finished.

The YouTube video for this is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONobtF52asA).
