This project is a browser extension that tries to keep you focused on a task. This is done by showing a page everytime you try to go to a website you shouldn't be browsing, like Instagram, Reddit or whatever you want.

The YouTube video for this is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONobtF52asA).
